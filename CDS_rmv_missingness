#To correct the problems encountered during alignment, sequences with >30% missing data were
#removed from the analysis.

#To identify sequences with >30% missing data, cleanfasta2/161123 was used.

#allExons.fas is the fasta file with the aligned exons/CDS 
#help ''5. Output format 'stats' will write out missingness and heterozygosity per sample (after excluding sites with
#missing data above treshold, and by windows if -winsize used''

###SCRIPT: ./script_missingness30###

awk '{print $1}' stats_paupergeneCDS > stats_column1

./script_missing2ness30 stats_column1 allExons.cnct.fas goodSamples.list.txt

#allExons was desinterleaved (allExons.cnct.fas) and put to ./script_missig2ness30
#This produced a list (goodSamples.list.txt) which contains all the new sequences with 
#less than 30% missingness
#celanfasta2 was then used to select from the fasta file containing all the sequences
#only the CDS in the goodSamples.list.txt
